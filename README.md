# SecAuth
a 176 line python script that i made (without AI)
im 13 years old.

features:
can create multiple user accounts (from within the program) with different passwords and sign into them.
im working on ban support to ban user accounts
includes error reporting to a file this includes:
logging the user name of any user who tries to log in but gets the password wrong 3 times.
logs if you cause an error by saying something random on the "would you like to sign in or create an account" part
logs if you get your 2FA code wrong.
logging of succesful user signing in, along with names and timestamps.
and alot of random comments
i also plan on making a super user account with a built in dev pannel.
